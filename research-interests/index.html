<h1>Research Interests</h1>
<p>The Tee lab studies the interplay between signaling networks and cellular metabolism, with an emphasis on developing non-invasive approaches to detect metabolism in health and disease.</p>

<h2>Areas</h2>
<h2>Research Directions</h2>

<div class="card">
  <h3 style="margin-top:0">Fructose Metabolism, Ketohexokinase, and Metabolic Stress Signaling</h3>
  <p>
    Our lab investigates how fructose metabolism shapes cellular function in health and disease, with a particular focus on ketohexokinase (KHK) as a metabolic and regulatory node. We study how fructose and glucose differentially regulate hepatic metabolism, ER proteostasis, growth factor signaling, and nutrient stress responses, and how these pathways are altered in obesity, fatty liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using molecular biology, proteomics, and metabolic imaging approaches, we aim to redefine fructose metabolism beyond classical fructolysis and identify metabolic vulnerabilities that can be leveraged for diagnosis and therapy.
  </p>

<div class="card">
  <h3 style="margin-top:0">Adipocyte Biology, Stem Cell Metabolism, and Diet-Induced Remodeling</h3>
  <p>
    A major research direction in the lab centers on how dietary sugars and obesogenic environments influence stem cell fate and adipocyte differentiation, particularly in brown and beige adipose tissue. We integrate single-cell optical techniques, including Raman imaging, optical diffraction tomography, and hyperspectral sensing, with cell and animal models to quantify how fructose and glucose modulate adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, cytokine signaling, and tissue remodeling.
  </p>
  <p>
    These studies extend to understanding diet-driven alterations in brain and systemic metabolism, linking nutrition to organ-level structural and functional outcomes.
  </p>

<div class="card">
  <h3 style="margin-top:0">Metabolic Imaging and Quantitative Biomarkers in Cancer and Metabolic Disease</h3>
  <p>
    The lab develops and applies advanced metabolic imaging technologies, including hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C MRI and MRS, to measure real-time metabolic flux in living cells, tissues, and animal models. Our work has established imaging biomarkers of tumor metabolism, therapy response, and metabolic reprogramming in cancer, while also extending these approaches to liver disease and metabolic dysfunction.
  </p>
  <p>
    By combining imaging physics, biochemical pathway analysis, and quantitative modeling, we aim to translate metabolic measurements into actionable biological and clinical insight.
